# IPL-win-prediction

ABSTRACT 

The Indian Premier League (IPL) is one of the most popular and competitive T20 cricket leagues in the world. With each team consisting of a mix of national and international players, predicting the outcome of matches and the eventual winner of the tournament is a challenging task. In this project, we propose to build a machine learning model to predict the win probability of each team in the IPL matches. We will use historical IPL data, including player statistics, team performance, and match results, to train the model. The outcome of this project will be a machine learning model that can accurately predict the win probability of each team in the IPL matches.  


INTRODUCTION  

The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional Twenty20 cricket league in India, consisting of eight teams representing different cities in the country. The league is known for its high intensity and competitiveness, with some of the best players from around the world participating. Predicting the outcome of a cricket match is always a challenging task, and the IPL is no exception. However, with the availability of large amounts of data, including player statistics, team performance, and match results, it is possible to build machine learning models that can predict the win probability of each team in the tournament. With accurate win probability predictions, fans can get a better understanding of the game and enjoy the IPL even more.
